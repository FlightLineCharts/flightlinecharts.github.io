# Guides
These guides are not recommanded officaily. But recommanded for enjoying realistic FLIGHTLINE. At least We think so.
You can learn about basis of communication between pilot and traffic controller, and also basic knowledge about flight procedures.

> :warning: **These guides was simplified.** Therefore, maybe there're somethings actually wrong or We've made as mistakes.<br>
> **Do not trust these guides at all.** For accurate information or knowledge about real-world flight, please google or study yourself.

## Guide - ATC Communication Channels
Basically, There're big FIVE channel that pilots communicate with ATC when the plane is near to the airport.
Let us show them to you: Delivery, Ground, Tower, Approach, Departure.

I'll show what you can do in those channel one by one.

### Delivery
Delivery(or DEL for short), simply saying, is the channel where you can submit your flight plan to controller and get a permission that you can fly with your own flight plan.
In real-world, The procedures of communicating with Delivery are too complex, so we can't equip those procedures into our game exactly.
We made those procedure simple, which we'll explain them right now. 

But before that, let us introduce one basic knowledge to you - IFR flight, and VFR flight.

#### IFR Flight / VFR Flight
IFR is stands for 'Instrument Flight Rules' and VFR is stands for 'Visual Flight Rules'.
IFR flight uses plane's instrument equipment for flying, while VFR flight does not.
In VFR flight, Pilot does not look at the instrument equipment, but flies while grasping the position with the main topographical features observed by the eyes.
It is strongly recommanded to use IFR espeacially for passenger flights.

For more information. google IFR / VFR.

You may follow the instructions below to communicate and get a permission with your flight plan.
In following examples, We'll use WJA 336 as plane's callsign. And we'll assume that controller is on JSLL Delivery.

1. **Radio Check**: Do Radio Check with this words 
+ **WJA 336:** "JSLL Delivery. good-day WJA 336 radio check."
+ **JSLL DEL:** "WJA 336. good-day loud and clear." ... The Controller says how's the radio sound from plane.
+ **WJA 336:** "Loud and clear also. WJA 336." ... The pilot says how's the radio sound from DEL.

2. **IFR Clearance**: Offer information about your destination, planned route, cruise attlitude, expected departure runway.
+ **WJA 336:** "JSLL Delivery. WJA 336 requesting IFR Clearance to JTPH via SACO1 JAMBA POBLO OSCAR2 departure, Flight level 10,000 feet runway 04 departure." ... those waypoint, SAC01, JAMBA, POBLO, OSCAR2 doesn't really exist in FLIGHTLINE right now. just use any words that hears like waypoint name.
+ **JSLL DEL:** "Stand by WJA 336." ... That means WJA 336 should wait.
+ **WJA 336:** "Standing by. WJA 336." ... When you got any command from atc controller, it is good choise to readback it. Reading back commands means you're saying that you understood those commands.
+ **JSLL DEL:** "WJA 336. JSLL Delivery. cleared for IFR Clearance to JTPH via SACO1 JAMBA POBLO OSCAR2 departure, Flight level 10,000 feet runway 04 departure. readback." ... The Delivery gave you a permission. When they call for readback, readback what they said.
+ **WJA 336:** "Cleared for IFR Clearance to JTPH via SACO1 JAMBA POBLO OSCAR2 departure, Flight level 10,000 feet runway 04 departure. WJA 336."
+ **JSLL DEL:** "WJA 336. Readback is correct. Contact JSLL Ground at 422.8." ... The Delivery said contact ground.
+ **WJA 336:** "Contact Ground. WJA 336." ... Always. Readback is important.
